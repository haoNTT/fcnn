# fcnn

A demo for fully connected neural network realized by programming in python

The dataset is derived from MNIST details can be found at the following link:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

For the two zip files, one named data_idx.zip contains the original version of MNIST data directly downloaded from MNIST official site
the other one named data_csv.zip is the csv version of the dataset which can be found at https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/

To run the original version of dataset, the program is ready to go. To run on csv files, uncomment the code for csv parsing.
